    9/8/2022: Over the Labor Day weekend I went to my friends house and swam for a couple of hours then watched Silent voice and Bird Box.
    This week has been really hot. Like 100 degrees everyday. I took a math, english, and science test today. I don't think it went well.
    I started to play league more and ranked up. <br>
